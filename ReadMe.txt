// I got this idea from kyes repo ^^
 all i did was use the rarreg.key | make a simple ui | use opendialog | make a "inject" system

// Kye has a repo based on winrar premium which will add a key into your install location
this does the same thing just in c# with a different ui

-- Notes: This is not a virus whatsoever... yes its flagged for a bunch of shit on virus total probably because its obfuscated
BUT ill probably make this open source as theres nothing to hide... i did a full scan with malwarebytes and its all good --

again this is not a virus... i would never distribute a virus thats just dumb asf and also youll see once its open src

// again just another "note" : please dont try and come after me for the flags : i know it says 17/56 (17 flags)
im pretty sure the reason its flagging as its obfuscated

            dont feel like reading? ---------->         TLDR: this is not a virus at all
